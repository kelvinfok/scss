    <h1>Sass is a CSS Preprocessor</h1>

        Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

    <h2>Why Sass</h2>
    <p>
        CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
    </p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
        Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <button class="good-btn">Use SASS</button>
    <button class="bad-btn">Stick to CSS</button>
</body>
</html>
